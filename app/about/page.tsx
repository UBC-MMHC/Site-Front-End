        We are a student-run organization dedicated to fostering a supportive community and promoting awareness about
        men's mental health issues at the University of British Columbia. Our goal is to destigmatize seeking help and
        encourage open conversation.

        Join us for workshops, discussion groups, and collaborative events throughout the academic year. Everyone is
        welcome to contribute to a healthier, more open campus environment.
